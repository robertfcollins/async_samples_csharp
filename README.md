# async_samples_csharp
Sample code I created for a course on writing async code with c# and .NET Core

The full course can be found here: https://www.edx.org/course/asynchronous-programming-c-net-core-microsoft-dev235x

The code was built using Visual Studio Code with the aim of making it cross-platform and easy to set up and run.

In writing the code, I attempted to balance the sometimes complex concepts involved in asynchrony against the need to make things straightforward for people approaching the concepts for the first time.

The loose "theme" of the labs was cryptocurrency mining, since that is a real-world problem that requires heavy usage of computing resources.
